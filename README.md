## General Information
- This project is a CLI (command line interface) that runs locally on your machine 
- The purpose of the project is to streamline the marking of COMP1000 student's Processing assignments.
- It was developed as an aid to mark the assignments and give an idea of how the student performed.
- Running the assignment and viewing the output would still be necessary to get an indicator of how the program visually performs
-PuNit was modeled around a sample assignment provided by Ansgar Fenker, convenor for COMP4050 at Macquarie University
